<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there! I'm Deniz, a traveler, content creator, soon to be a web developer and former corporate professional
  who traded the hustle and bustle for a life of adventure. Originally from Turkey, I've lived in multiple cities
  due to my father's military career and have traveled to over 30 countries. After a major life shift, I decided to leave
  it all behind and start fresh in the Philippines, where I now call Dumaguete home.

<p>
  With a background in English Language and Literature, I've always been passionate about storytelling and sharing
  experiences. Now, I'm channeling that into creating engaging Youtube videos about my life in the Philippines,
  cultural insights, and the unique experiences I encounter along the way
</p>
<p>
  I'm also learning coding through an online course I purchased from Udemy. As someone who loves exploring new
  skills and adapting to different environments, I'm excited to dive into the world of programming and see
  where it takes me.
